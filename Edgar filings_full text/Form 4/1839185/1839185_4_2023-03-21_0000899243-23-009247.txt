        <footnote id="F3">(Continued from Footnote 2) Immediately before the effective time of the First Merger (the &quot;First Merger Effective Time&quot;), an aggregate of 1,446,525 Class B ordinary shares held by Summit Healthcare Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) was surrendered for nil consideration, and after such surrender, each Class B ordinary share ceased to be outstanding and automatically converted into the right to receive one Ordinary Share of YS Biopharma.</footnote>
