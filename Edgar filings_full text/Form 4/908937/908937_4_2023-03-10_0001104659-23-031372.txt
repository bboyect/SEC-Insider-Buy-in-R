        <footnote id="F1">Each $1,000 original principal amount of 2.125% exchangeable senior debentures due 2048 (the &quot;Debentures&quot;) is exchangeable for 124.6922 shares of the issuer's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;), settled only in cash based on the value of the shares of Common Stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each Debenture is exchangeable at the option of the holder during specified periods as set forth in the Remarks section. Holders of the Debentures may put them to the reporting person on April 7, 2023, or prior thereto following the occurrence of a &quot;fundamental change,&quot; and the Debentures may be redeemed by the reporting person, (i) in whole or in part, on or after April 7, 2023 at any time, or (ii) in whole, but not in part, prior to April 7, 2023, after the occurrence of certain conditions or events.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">On March 8, 2023, the reporting person repurchased, in cash, $115,948,000 aggregate original principal amount of the Debentures. Holders of the Debentures received payment of $967.15 for each $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures accepted for purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest.</footnote>

    <remarks>Each Debenture is exchangeable at the option of the holder, subject to certain terms and conditions, during specified periods after: (i) the market value of the underlying Common Stock exceeds 130% of the principal amount of the Debenture; (ii) the trading price of a Debenture is less than 98% of the market value of the underlying Common Stock; (iii) the occurrence of a &quot;fundamental change&quot; or a &quot;make-whole fundamental change&quot; with respect to a significant reference company; (iv) the Debenture is called for redemption; (v) the reporting person elects to transfer its obligations under the Debentures and the indenture governing the Debentures to a &quot;qualified successor entity&quot; and the reporting person does not provide an irrevocable, full and unconditional guarantee of the &quot;qualified successor entity's&quot; payment obligations thereunder; and (vi) the issuer of the Common Stock declares or makes a dividend or distribution that, pursuant to the terms of the Debentures, would reduce the principal amount of the Debentures to $0.00 or such principal amount is otherwise reduced to $0.00.
