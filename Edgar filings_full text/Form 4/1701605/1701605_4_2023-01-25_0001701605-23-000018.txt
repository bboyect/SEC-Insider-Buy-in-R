the rules and regulations issued thereunder, Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and any
Form 144, Form 8-K or other form required to be filed relating to the transaction covered by such report (collectively,
the "Required Forms");

(2)    do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete
and execute any such Required Forms and timely file such Required Forms with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, any stock exchange, or other authority or body; and

(3)    take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing which, in the opinion of any of such
attorneys-in-fact or their substitutes, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by any of such attorneys-in-fact or their substitutes on behalf
of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as
any of such attorneys-in-fact or their substitutes may approve in the discretion of any such person.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact or their substitutes full power and authority to do and perform
any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and
powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could do if personally present, with
full power of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that any of such attorneys-in-fact, or the
or substitutes of any of such attorneys-in-fact, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of
Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact or their

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be effective as of the 29th day of July, 2022.
