POWER OF ATTORNEY

The undersigned (the "Reporting Person") hereby constitutes and appoints Jacobo
Cohen Imach, Pedro Arnt, Marcelo Melamud, Christopher C. Green, Esq. and James
V. Davidson, Esq. and each of them, as the Reporting Person's true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to:

(1) prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's behalf,
and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID,
including amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate
to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to make electronic
filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC,

(2) execute for and on behalf of the Reporting Person, in the Reporting Person's
capacity as a director and/or officer of MercadoLibre, Inc. (the "Company"),
Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and the rules thereunder,

(3) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the Reporting Person
which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4
or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file
such form with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority, and

(4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the Reporting Person, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
Reporting Person pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and
shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in
such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The Reporting Person grants to such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to
do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or
proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein
granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the Reporting Person might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact shall lawfully do
or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and
powers herein granted. The Reporting Person acknowledges that the foregoing
attorney-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of the Reporting
Person, is not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the Reporting
Person's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in effect until the Reporting Person is no
longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the Reporting Person's
holdings of, and transactions in securities issued by, the Company, unless
earlier revoked by the Reporting Person in a signed writing delivered to the
attorney-in-fact.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Reporting Person has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed on December 13, 2012.
