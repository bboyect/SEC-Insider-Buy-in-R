Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Ronald Basso, Aaron L. Wax, Jeffrey W. Acre and D.
Mark McMillan, or any of them acting singly and with full power of
substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

1. execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
capacity as an officer or director or both of Coherent Corp. (the
"Company"), Forms 3, 4 and 5 (and any amendments thereto) in accordance
with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), and the rules thereunder, and Form 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules
thereunder;

2. do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such
Form 3, 4, 5 or 144, complete and execute any amendments thereto, and
timely file such form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") and any securities exchange or similar authority, including
without limitation the filing of a Form ID or any other documents
necessary or appropriate to enable the undersigned to file the Forms 3,
4, 5 and 144 electronically with the SEC;

3. seek or obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the
undersigned's behalf, information on transactions in the Company's
securities from any third party, including brokers, employee benefit plan
administrators and trustees, and the undersigned hereby authorizes any
such person to release any such information to each of the undersigned's
attorneys-in-fact appointed by this Limited Power of Attorney and
approves and ratifies any such release of information; and

4. take any other action in connection with the foregoing which, in the
opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best
interest of, or legally required by or for, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf
of the undersigned pursuant to this Limited Power of Attorney shall be in
such form and shall contain such information and disclosure as such
attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
required, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the
rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as
the undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power
of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that
such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or
substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this
Limited Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.

The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request and on the behalf of the
undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the
undersigned's responsibilities to comply with, or any liability for the
failure to comply with, any provision of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
or Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

This Limited Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, 5 or 144 with respect to
the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the
Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing
delivered to each of the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

[Signature page follows]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Limited Power of
Attorney as of this 14th of June, 2023.
