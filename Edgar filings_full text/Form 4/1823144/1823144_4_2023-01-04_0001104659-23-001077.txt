        <footnote id="F1">Reflects the number of shares withheld in satisfaction of applicable tax withholding obligations in connection with the net settlement of 280,863 restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) that vested on January 1, 2023. These RSUs were originally granted on March 16, 2022 in the aggregate amount of 1,123,451 RSUs, for which the remaining 842,588 RSUs (the &quot;Unvested Time-Vesting RSUs&quot;) will continue to vest ratably on each of January 1, 2024, January 1, 2025 and January 1, 2026, respectively, subject to the reporting person's continued service as of the applicable vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes (A) 186,360 shares of Class A Common Stock owned directly by the reporting person, (B) 842,588 shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Unvested Time-Vesting RSUs, and (C) 449,380 performance-vested RSUs, which will vest over the applicable performance period based on the achievement of the provided performance targets, as set forth in the governing award agreement, subject to the reporting person's continued service as of the applicable vesting date. The RSUs will be settled into Class A Common Stock upon vesting and may be settled net of shares withheld to pay applicable taxes.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The total reported above does not include 1,236,027 shares of Class B Common Stock, and a corresponding number of Class B Common Units issued by CompoSecure Holdings, L.L.C. that are exchangeable for Class A Common Stock on a share-for-share basis, subject to adjustment, and a corresponding cancellation of the Class B Common Stock, held by CompoSecure Employee LLC. Mr. Wilk may be deemed the beneficial owner of the 1,236,027 shares of Class B Common Stock because he is the sole member of the CompoSecure Employee LLC.</footnote>
