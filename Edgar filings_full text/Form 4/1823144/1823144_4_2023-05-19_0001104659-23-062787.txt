        <footnote id="F2">The total reported above does not include 14,180,147, 849,502 and 6,534,630 shares of Class B Common Stock, and a corresponding number of Class B Common Units issued by CompoSecure Holdings, L.L.C. that are exchangeable for Class A Common Stock on a share-for-share basis, subject to adjustment, and a corresponding cancellation of the Class B Common Stock, held by the reporting person, the Carol D. Herslow Credit Shelter Trust B (&quot;Credit Shelter Trust&quot;) and Ephesians 3:16 Holdings LLC (&quot;Ephesians Holdings&quot;), respectively. Ms. Logan may be deemed the beneficial owner of the 849,502 and 6,534,630 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Credit Shelter Trust and Ephesians Holdings, respectively, because Ms. Logan is a Co-Trustee of the Credit Shelter Trust and serves as the manager of Ephesians Holdings.</footnote>
