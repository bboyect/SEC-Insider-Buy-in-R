        <footnote id="F1">On April 21, 2023, the Issuer announced that it will not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required. Pursuant to the Issuer's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association  and in connection with the winding up of the Issuer, the Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, held by the Reporting Person were surrendered for no compensation on May 19, 2023.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">This Form 4 is being filed by the Sponsor. The Class B ordinary shares are held in the name of the Sponsor. The Sponsor is managed by a board of managers comprised of Paul J. Salem, Martin J. Mannion, Christopher S. Satti and Frederic A. Flaxman. Each manager has one vote, and the approval of a majority is required to approve an action of the Sponsor. Under the so-called &quot;rule of three,&quot; if voting and dispositive decisions regarding an entity's securities are made by three or more individuals, and a voting or dispositive decision requires the approval of a majority of those individuals, then none of the individuals is deemed a beneficial owner of the entity's securities. This is the situation with regard to the Sponsor. Based upon the foregoing analysis, no individual manager of the Sponsor exercises voting or dispositive control over any of the securities held by the Sponsor, even those in which he directly holds a pecuniary interest.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">(Continued from Footnote 2) Accordingly, none of them will be deemed to have or share beneficial ownership of such shares.</footnote>

    <remarks>After giving effect to the Issuer's delisting and deregistration, the Reporting Person will no longer be subject to Section 16 reporting obligations.</remarks>
