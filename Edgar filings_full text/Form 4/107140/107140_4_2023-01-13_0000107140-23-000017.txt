1. Prepare, acknowledge, execute, deliver and file for and on behalf, in the undersignedTMs
capacity as an officer and/or director of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (the Company) Forms 3,
4, and 5 (including any amendments thereto), including applications for Form ID, in
accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
thereunder, and any other forms or reports the undersigned may be required to file in
connection with the undersignedTMs ownership, acquisition or disposition of securities of the
Company;

2. Do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which may be
necessary or desirable to complete the execution of any such Form 3, 4, or 5, or other form
of report, and the timely filing of such form with the United States Securities and Exchange

3. Take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing which, in the
opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally
required by, the undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in
such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may

The undersigned grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and
perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary and proper to be done in the

revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or her/his substitute or
substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be herein granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the
