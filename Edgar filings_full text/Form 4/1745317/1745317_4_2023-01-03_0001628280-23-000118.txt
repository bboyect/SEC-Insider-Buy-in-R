        <footnote id="F2">The sales reported on this Form 4 represent shares required to be sold by the Reporting Person to cover tax withholding obligations in connection with the previously reported vesting and settlement of RSUs. These sales are mandated by the Reporting Person's award agreement to require the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations to be funded by a &quot;sell to cover&quot; transaction and do not represent discretionary trades by the Reporting Person.</footnote>
