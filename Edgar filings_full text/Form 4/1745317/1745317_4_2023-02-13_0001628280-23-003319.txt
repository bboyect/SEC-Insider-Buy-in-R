(&quot;Ouster&quot;), Oban Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ouster, Oban Merger Sub II LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ouster, and Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (&quot;Velodyne&quot;) occurred, pursuant to which Velodyne merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Ouster (the &quot;Merger&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">At the effective time of the Merger (the &quot;Effective Time&quot;), each performance-based restricted stock award was deemed to be met at the target level of achievement of the performance goals, resulting in a forfeiture of shares above the target level.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Velodyne common stock automatically converted to the right to receive 0.8204 of a share of Ouster common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The Reporting Person received Restricted Stock Units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) in connection with the merger described in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 2, 2020 (the &quot;Merger&quot;), and amended on August 20, 2020, by and among Graf Industrial Corp., a Delaware corporation now known as Velodyne Lidar, Inc.

        <footnote id="F5">The Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) were received in exchange for 40,000 RSUs in Velodyne Lidar USA, Inc. in connection with the Merger.  Subject to the satisfaction of both a liquidity event requirement and service-based requirement, each RSU represents the right to receive one (1) share of Common Stock.  The liquidity-event requirement was deemed satisfied by the Board of Directors of New Velodyne in October 2020 and the service-based requirement will be or, as applicable, was satisfied with respect to 25% of the RSUs when the Reporting Person remains or, as applicable, remained in continuous service through the one-year anniversary of January 27, 2020 and with respect to six-and-one-quarter percent (6.25%) of the RSUs when the Reporting Person completes or, as applicable, completed each three (3) months of continous service thereafter.</footnote>
