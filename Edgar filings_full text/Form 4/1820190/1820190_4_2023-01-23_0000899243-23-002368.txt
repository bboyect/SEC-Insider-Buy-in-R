        <footnote id="F1">On January 19, 2023, the Reporting Person paid its previously announced stock dividend (the &quot;Dividend&quot;) consisting of an aggregate of 75,999,853 shares of common stock of Scilex Holding Company held by the Reporting Person (the &quot;Dividend Shares&quot;) to record holders of the Reporting Person's common stock and certain warrants to purchase the Reporting Person's common stock as of January 9, 2023 (the &quot;Record Date&quot;).  An aggregate of 2,259,058 Dividend Shares are being held in abeyance by the Reporting Person for the benefit of certain holders of warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Reporting Person who may be entitled to such shares pursuant to the terms of the applicable warrants following the exercise of such warrants, and at the time such shares are distributed to the applicable warrantholders, the Reporting Person will file a Form 4 reporting such distribution.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">(Continued form footnote 1) The Reporting Person distributed 0.1410127 of a share of the Issuer's common stock for each share of the Reporting Person's common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date. The stock ratio was calculated by dividing 76,000,000 by the number of shares of the Reporting Person's common stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Reporting Person's common stock outstanding on the Record Date. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Dividend and the equityholders of the Reporting Person who were entitled to receive fractional shares of the Dividend Stock received cash (without interest) in lieu of such fractional shares.</footnote>
