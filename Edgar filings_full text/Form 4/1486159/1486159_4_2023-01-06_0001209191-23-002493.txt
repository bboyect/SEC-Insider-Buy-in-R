    <footnotes>
        <footnote id="F1">In connection with the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units through the issuance of the Issuer's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&quot;Common Stock&quot;), the Issuer withheld Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued to the Reporting Person to satisfy his tax withholding obligations.  The number of shares of Common Stock withheld was determined based on the closing price per share of Common Stock on January 4, 2023.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The number of shares of common stock shown in Table 1, Column 5 has been adjusted from prior filings to correct an inadvertent understatement of the number of shares of common stock (including common stock equivalents such as equity awards that were previously reported in Table 1) that are beneficially owned by the Reporting Person, which understatement was initially contained in the Form 4 filed by the Reporting Person on July 1, 2022.</footnote>
