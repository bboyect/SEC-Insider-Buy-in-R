        <footnote id="F1">This transaction involved the transfer of shares of Class A Common Stock to a GRAT, of which the reporting person is not a trustee.  In addition, the reporting person no longer serves as trustee of another GRAT that had previously been reported as indirectly owned beneficially.  Therefore, the reporting person no longer reports indirect beneficial ownership of the shares of Class A Common Stock held by such GRAT.</footnote>
