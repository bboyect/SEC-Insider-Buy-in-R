        <footnote id="F1">On June 16, 2023, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (&quot;Fairfax&quot;), purchased 200,000 shares of the Issuer's 6.00% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (&quot;Preferred Stock&quot;) and warrants (the &quot;Warrants&quot;) to purchase 12,338,062 shares of the common stock of the Issuer, for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000,000.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Warrants may be exercised at any time, in whole or in part, for seven years from the date of issuance at an exercise price per Warrant of $16.21, subject to anti-dilution adjustment. Upon exercise of any Warrants, the holder of such Warrants has the right to reduce the cash amount to be paid with respect to the exercise price of the Warrant on a dollar-for-dollar basis by requiring the Issuer to instead extinguish shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder (using a value of $1,000 per share of Preferred Stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends) equal to up to the aggregate exercise price for such exercised Warrants.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends from the Issuer, payable quarterly on the $1,000 per share liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock, at a rate of 6.00% per annum. The Preferred Stock has no expiration date but may be redeemed at any time by the Issuer, at its option, in whole or in part, for cash.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">These securities are held by subsidiaries of Fairfax. Mr. Watsa is the CEO and controlling person of Fairfax through the other reporting persons. Each of the reporting persons disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein for purposes of Rule 16a-1(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), except to the extent of its or his pecuniary interest therein, if any. This report shall not be deemed an admission that any of the reporting persons is a beneficial owner for the purpose of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or for any other purpose.</footnote>
