        <footnote id="F1">These securities are restricted stock units (RSUs). Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of Common Stock of the Issuer. 100% of the RSUs shall vest on the earlier of July 13, 2024 or the date of the Issuer's 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, subject to the Reporting Person continuing to be an Outside Director (as defined in the Issuer's 2022 Equity Inventive Plan) through the applicable vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The number of shares owned by this Reporting Person have been adjusted to correct cumulative errors in prior beneficial ownership reports. These errors stem from: (1) Form 3 filed on November 12, 2021 which should have reported beneficial ownership of 101,818 shares of common stock directly owned;
(2) Form 4 filed on November 15, 2021 which incorrectly added direct ownership and indirect ownership, and (3) Form 4 filed on February 13, 2023, which incorrectly disclosed the disposition of 125,351 of 164,610 shares held by WPE Ventures Partnership. These shares were held by WPE Ventures Partnership, of which the Reporting Person was the managing partner. The remaining 39,259 shares held by WPE Ventures Partnership, of which the Reporting Person was the managing partner, was transferred to Mr. Willem Elfrink directly.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">These shares are held by the Elfrink Living Trust, of which the Reporting Person is the trustee.</footnote>
