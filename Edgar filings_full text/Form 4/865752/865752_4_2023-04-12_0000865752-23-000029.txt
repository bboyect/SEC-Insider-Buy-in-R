        <footnote id="F1">Each restricted stock unit represents either (i) a contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock or (ii) a cash amount equal to the number of shares received as of the vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The restricted stock units vest with respect to 100% of such restricted stock units on the last business day prior to the Company's 2023 annual stockholder meeting, provided that the reporting person continues as a director of the Company through such date.</footnote>

        <footnote id="F5">On March 27, 2023, the common stock of the Company split 2-for-1 (the &quot;Stock Split&quot;).  As a result, the number of shares of common stock to be settled by the Company and delivered to the reporting person under the Company's equity incentive compensation plans or agreements governing restricted stock units (or the cash equivalent of such shares) were doubled.</footnote>

        <footnote id="F8">The deferred stock units credited under the Deferral Plan are settled (other than fractional units) in stock and are generally payable in the form elected or provided under the Deferral Plan on the earliest of: (i) a specified date or event designated by the reporting person, (ii) in the calendar year following the year in which the reporting person's service with the Board of Directors of the Company separates, or (iii) upon death, disability or change in control as defined under the Deferral Plan.</footnote>
