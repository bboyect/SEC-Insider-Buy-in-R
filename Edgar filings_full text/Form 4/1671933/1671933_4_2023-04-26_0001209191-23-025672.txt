	(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the

understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall

	The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact, acting singly,
full power and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing
whatsoever requisite, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of
