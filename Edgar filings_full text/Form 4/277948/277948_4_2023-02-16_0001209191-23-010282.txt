submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID,
including amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate
to obtain codes and passwords enabling the Appointer to make electronic filings
with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
rules thereunder;

be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5,
complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such
form with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by the Appointer, it being
