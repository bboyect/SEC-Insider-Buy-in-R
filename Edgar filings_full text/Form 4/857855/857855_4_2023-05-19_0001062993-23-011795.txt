         (1)      Execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
                  undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director
                  of United  Community  Banks,  Inc. (the  "Company"),
                  Forms 3, 4, and 5 in  accordance  with Section 16(a)
                  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
                  thereunder;

         (2)      Do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of
                  the undersigned  which may be necessary or desirable
                  to  complete  and  execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5,
                  complete  and execute any  amendment  or  amendments
                  thereto,  and timely  file such form with the United
                  States  Securities  and Exchange  Commission and any
                  stock exchange or similar authority; and

         (3)      Take any  other  action  of any type  whatsoever  in
                  connection with the foregoing  which, in the opinion
                  of such  attorney-in-fact,  may be of benefit to, in
                  the best  interest  of, or legally  required by, the
                  undersigned,  it being understood that the documents
                  executed by such  attorney-in-fact  on behalf of the
                  undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall
                  be in such form and  shall  contain  such  terms and
                  conditions as such  attorney-in-fact  may approve in
                  such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

         The undersigned hereby grants to each such  attorney-in-fact full power
and  authority  to do and  perform  any  and  every  act  and  thing  whatsoever

undersigned's  responsibilities  to comply  with  Section  16 of the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

         This Power of Attorney  shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer  required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's  holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the  undersigned in a signed writing  delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact.


         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  THE UNDERSIGNED HAS CAUSED THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY
