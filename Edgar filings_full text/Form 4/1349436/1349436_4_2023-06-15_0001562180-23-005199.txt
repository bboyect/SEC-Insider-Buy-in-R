POWER OF ATTORNEY

For Executing Forms 3, 4 and 5, Form 144 and Schedules 13D and 13G


	Know all by these presents that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Gaye Wilkerson, Salah Gamoudi, Ben Smolij and Michael
Blankenship, signing singularly, the undersigned's true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to:

(1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned (a) Forms 3, 4 and 5(including
 amendments thereto) in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder, (b)Form 144 in accordance with
Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, and (c) Schedules 13D and 13G
(including amendments thereto) in accordance with Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned that
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4 or 5,
Form 144, or Schedule 13D or 13G (including amendments thereto) and timely file
 such Forms or Schedules with the Securities and Exchange Commission and any
stock exchange, self-regulatory association or any other authority; and

(3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing that, in the opinion of each such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit
 to, in the best interest of, or legally required of the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
 undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
 contain such terms and conditions as the attorney-in-fact may approve in the
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

	The undersigned hereby grants to each attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might
or could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or
revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that the attorney-in-fact, or
the attorney-in-facts substitutes or substitute, shall lawfully do or cause to
be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact,
and their substitutes, in serving in such capacity at the request of the
undersigned, are not assuming (nor is SandRidge Energy, Inc. assuming) any of
the undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

	The undersigned agrees that each such attorney-in-fact may rely entirely on
information furnished orally or in writing by the undersigned to the
attorney-in-fact.  The undersigned also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and each such attorney-in-fact against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in these respects) that arise out of
 or are based upon any untrue statements or omissions of necessary facts in the
 information provided by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact for purposes
of executing, acknowledging, delivering or filing Form 3, 4 or 5, Form 144 or
Schedule 13D or 13G (including amendments thereto) and agrees to reimburse
SandRidge Energy, Inc. and the attorney-in-fact on demand for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

	As to each of the attorneys-in-fact, this Power of Attorney shall remain in
full force and effect until the earlier to occur of: (i) the undersigned being
no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5, Form 144 and Schedules 13D and 13G
 (including amendments thereto) with respect to the undersigned's holdings of
and transactions in securities issued by SandRidge Energy, Inc.; (ii) such
attorney-in-fact being no longer employed by SandRidge Energy, Inc.; or (iii)
the undersigned revoking this Power of Attorney in a signed writing delivered
to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.  This Power of Attorney supersedes any
power of attorney that the undersigned has previously granted in connection
with matters substantially similar to those discussed herein, and any and all
such previous powers of attorney are hereby revoked.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of the date written below.
