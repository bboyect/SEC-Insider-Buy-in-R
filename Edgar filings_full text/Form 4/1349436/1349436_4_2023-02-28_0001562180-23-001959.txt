EXHIBIT 24


POWER OF ATTORNEY
For Executing Forms 3, 4 and 5, Form 144
and Schedules 13D and 13G


Know all by these presents, that the undersigned
hereby constitutes and appoints Gaye Wilkerson,
Signing singularly, the undersigned's true and
lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned
(a) Forms 3, 4, and 5 (including amendments thereto)
in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder,
(b) Form 144 in accordance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, and (c) Schedule 13D and 13G
(including amendments thereto) in accordance with
Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(2) do and perform any and all acts for and on
behalf of the undersigned that may be necessary or
desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4
or 5, Form 144, or Schedules 13D or 13G (including
amendments thereto) and timely file such Forms or
Schedules with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and any stock exchange, self-regulatory association
or any other authority; and

(3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in
connection with the foregoing that, in the opinion of
each such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the
best interest of, or legally required of the
undersigned, it being understood that the documents
executed by the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall
be in such form and shall contain such terms and
conditions as the attorney-in-fact may approve in the
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each attorney-
in-fact full power and authority to do and perform
all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any
of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully to
all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and
confirming all that the attorney-in-fact, or the
attorney-in-facts substitutes or substitute, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this
Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact, and their substitutes,
in serving in such capacity at the request of the
undersigned, are not assuming (nor is SandRidge
Energy, Inc. assuming) any of the undersigned's
responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The undersigned agrees that each such attorney-in-
fact may rely entirely on information furnished
orally or in writing by the undersigned to the
attorney-in-fact.  The undersigned also agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless SandRidge Energy, Inc.
and each such attorney-in-fact against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in these
respects) that arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statements or omissions of necessary facts in
the information provided by the undersigned to such
attorney-in-fact for purposes of executing,
acknowledging, deliveringor filing Form 3, 4 or 5,
Form 144 or Schedule 13D or 13G (including amendments
thereto) and agrees to reimburse SandRidge Energy, Inc.
and the attorney-in-fact on demand for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with investigating or defending against any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action.

As to each of the attorneys-in-fact, this Power of
Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until
the earlier to occur of: (i) the undersigned being no
longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5, Form 144 and
Schedules 13D and 13G (including amendments thereto)
with respect to the undersigned's holdings of and
transactions in securities issued by SandRidge
Energy, Inc.; (ii) such attorney-in-fact being no longer
employed by SandRidge Energy, Inc.; or (iii) the
undersigned revoking this Power of Attorney in a signed
writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.
This Power of Attorney supercedes any power of attorney
that the undersigned has previously granted in connection
with matters substantially similar to those discussed
herein, and any and all such previous powers of attorney
are hereby revoked.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this
Power of Attorney to be executed as of the date written
below.
