With this Power of Attorney, the undersigned, Matthew A. Hunton, hereby appoints each of Ismat Aziz, John M. Boschelli, C. Thomas Evans, Jr., Baird S. Allis and James J. McKinney, so long as such individual remains an officer of Kemper Corporation, as the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact with the power and authority individually to execute and file on the undersigned's behalf all Forms 3, 4, 5, and 144 (including any amendments, successor or related forms thereto) that the undersigned may from time to time be required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of the undersigned's ownership of, or transactions in, securities of Kemper Corporation, and to take such other actions which such attorney-in-fact believes necessary or appropriate in connection with the filing of such forms.
