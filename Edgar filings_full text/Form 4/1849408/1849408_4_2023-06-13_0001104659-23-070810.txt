        <footnote id="F1">On June 2, 2023, Zimmer Energy Transition Acquisition Corp. (the &quot;Issuer&quot;) announced that it will redeem all of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock that were included in the units issued in its initial public offering (the &quot;Public Shares&quot;), as the Issuer will not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The per share redemption price for the Public Shares will be $10.24600261, which was definitively determined on June 9, 2023. As of the close of business on June 16, 2023, the Public Shares, including all shares of Class A Common Stock that were beneficially owned by the Reporting Person, will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount.</footnote>
