         LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR SECTION 16 REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Theresa Ellen (Tia) Cudahy and Marianna Shelenkova, or either
of them acting singly and with full power of substitution, as the undersigned's
true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

        1.execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
        capacity as an officer or director or both of CuriosityStream Inc. (the
        "Company"), Forms 3, 4 and 5 (and any amendments thereto) in accordance
        with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
        (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules thereunder;

        2.do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
        undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute
        any such Form 3, 4 or 5, complete and execute any amendments thereto,
        and timely file such form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
        Commission (the "SEC") and any securities exchange or similar
        authority, including without limitation the filing of a Form ID or any
        other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the undersigned to
        file the Forms 3, 4 and 5 electronically with the SEC; and

        3.take any other action in connection with the foregoing which, in
        the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best
        interest of, or legally required by or for, the undersigned, it being
        understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on
        behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Limited Power of Attorney
        shall be in such form and shall contain such information and disclosure
        as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's
        discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever required,
necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might
or could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or
revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or
such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause
to be done by virtue of this Limited Power of Attorney and the rights and
powers herein granted.

The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving
in such capacity at the request and on the behalf of the undersigned, are not
assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's
responsibilities to comply with, or any liability for the failure to comply
with, any provision of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

This Limited Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 or 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to each
of the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Limited Power of Attorney
as of this 23rd day of February, 2023.

                                   Signed and acknowledged:



                                   /s/ Elizabeth Ann Hendricks
