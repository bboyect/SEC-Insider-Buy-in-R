(ii) Forms 3, 4 and 5, (iii) Schedule 13D, (iv) Schedule 13G and (v) amendments
of each thereof, in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules thereunder;
(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3,
4 or 5, Schedule 13D. Schedule 13G or any amendments thereto and timely file
such form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and any
stock exchange or similar authority; and
(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit
to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it
being understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on
behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in
such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as such
attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.
       The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the
rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
