to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to
my beneficial ownership of securities in the Company.

I hereby grant to each such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and
perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary or proper to
be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully
to all intents and purposes as I might or could do if personally present, with
full power of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or

attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  I acknowledge that the
foregoing attorney-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at my request, is not
assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of my responsibilities to comply with
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

This authorization shall remain in effect until I am no longer required to file
forms under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with
respect to the Company's securities, unless earlier revoked in writing delivered
to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

Date: February 13, 2023
