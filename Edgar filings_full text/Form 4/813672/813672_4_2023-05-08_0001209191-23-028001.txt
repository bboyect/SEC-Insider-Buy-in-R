I, Julia Liuson, hereby authorize each of John Wall, Karna Nisewaner, Stephanie
Wells and Ahalya Hildreth of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), to sign and file on my behalf the Initial Statement
of Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 3, the Statements of Changes in
Beneficial Ownership on Forms 4 and 5 and any amendments and applications
thereto, to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to
my beneficial ownership of securities in the Company.

I hereby grant to each such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and
perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary or proper to
be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully
to all intents and purposes as I might or could do if personally present, with
full power of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or
substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of
attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  I acknowledge that the
foregoing attorney-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at my request, is not
assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of my responsibilities to comply with
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

This shall remain in effect until I am no longer required to file forms under
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to
the Company's securities, unless earlier revoked in writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact.
