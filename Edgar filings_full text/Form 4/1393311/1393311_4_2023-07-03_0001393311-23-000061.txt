        <footnote id="F1">Grant of fully-vested deferred stock units pursuant to the Company's Non-Management Trustee Compensation and Deferral Program under the Company's 2021 Equity and Performance-Based Incentive Compensation Plan. Each deferred stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock. The number of deferred stock units granted represents the quotient of the dollar amount of the portion of the cash retainers the reporting person has earned for the applicable calendar quarter and elected to be paid in deferred stock units, divided by the Company's closing stock price on the grant date, rounded up to the nearest deferred stock unit. The deferred stock units will be settled in shares of unrestricted common stock (i) in a lump sum upon the reporting person's separation from service as a trustee or (ii) in a lump sum upon the reporting person's earlier death or disability or upon an earlier change of control of the Company.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes 17,300 restricted stock units and 2,093 deferred stock units.</footnote>
