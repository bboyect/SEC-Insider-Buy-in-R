      The undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints each of

(1)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of
NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ?Corporation?),
Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section?16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder
and Form 144 in accordance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933;
(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on
behalf of the undersigned which may be necessary or
desirable to complete and execute any such Form?3, 4, 5
or 144 and timely file such Form with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, either manually or
through the use of EDGAR, the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval system, and with any stock
exchange or similar authority; and
(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in
connection with the foregoing which, in the opinion of
such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best
 interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it
being understood that the documents executed by such
 attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant
 to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and
shall contain such terms and conditions as such
attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's
discretion.
      The undersigned hereby grants to each such
      attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and perform
      any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary,
      or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
      and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and

	revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered
