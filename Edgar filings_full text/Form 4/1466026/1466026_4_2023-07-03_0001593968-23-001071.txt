       (1) prepare, execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, and
submit to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling

required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), or any rule or regulation of the SEC;
       (2) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
undersigned's capacity as a reporting person of Midland States Bancorp,
Inc. (the "Company") pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules thereunder, Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules thereunder;
       (3) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any
such Form 3, 4 or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto and file such form with the Commission and the applicable stock
exchange or similar authority; and
       (4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with
the foregoing which, in the opinion of any of such attorneys-in-fact, may
be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by any of such

       The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full
power and authority to act separately and to do and perform any and every
act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the
