        <footnote id="F1">The shares of common stock (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;) of PG&amp;E Corporation (the &quot;Issuer&quot;) reported herein are held directly by the PG&amp;E Fire Victim Trust (the &quot;Trust&quot;). Cathy Yanni serves as the trustee (the &quot;Trustee&quot;) of the Trust and, solely in such capacity, may be deemed to have beneficial ownership in the shares of Common Stock held by the Trust. The Trustee has no pecuniary interest in the shares of Common Stock held by the Trust and specifically disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Pursuant to the Issuer's Plan of Reorganization (the &quot;Plan&quot;), effective as of July 1, 2020 (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;), in certain circumstances the Issuer is required to issue additional shares of Common Stock to the Trust if, after the Effective Date, the Issuer issues additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan. The number of additional shares to be issued to the Trust is determined such that the Trust would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding Common Stock (as calculated pursuant to the Plan), assuming that any such additional issuances had occurred on the Effective Date.</footnote>
