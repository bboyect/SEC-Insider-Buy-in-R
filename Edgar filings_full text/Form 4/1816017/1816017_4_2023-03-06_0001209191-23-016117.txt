POWER OF ATTORNEY

I, Thomas Krywe, hereby authorize and designate each of Boyd Johnson, Kelly
Loughery, Jonathan R. Zimmerman, Griffin D. Foster, Christine G. Long, Charles
D. Lange, RoxAnn D. Mack, Candice Demele and Amra Hoso signing singly, as my
true and lawful attorney in fact to:

(1)	prepare and execute for and on my behalf, in my capacity as an officer
and/or director of Spire Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), a
Form ID and Forms 3, 4 and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and other forms or reports on my behalf as
may be required to be filed in connection with my ownership, acquisition, or
disposition of securities of the Company, including Form 144;

(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on my behalf that may be necessary
or desirable to complete and execute any such Form ID, Form 3, 4 or 5 or Form
144, and any amendments to any of the foregoing, and timely file any such form
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or similar
authority; and

(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney in fact, may be to my benefit,
in my best interest, or legally required of me, it being understood that the
statements executed by such attorney in fact on my behalf pursuant to this Power
of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as
such attorney in fact may approve in such attorney in facts discretion.

I hereby further grant to each such attorney in fact full power and authority to
do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or
proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein
granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as I might or could do if
personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation, hereby
ratifying and confirming all that such attorney in fact, or such attorney in
facts substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  I hereby
acknowledge that the foregoing attorneys in fact, in serving in such capacity at
my request, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of my
responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act or Rule 144 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until I am no
longer required to file Form ID or Forms 3, 4 and 5 or Form 144 with respect to
my holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless
earlier revoked by me in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys
in fact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such attorney-in-fact hereafter
ceases to be at least one of the following: (i) an employee of the Company, or
(ii) a partner or employee of Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, then this Power
of Attorney shall be automatically revoked solely as to such individual,
immediately upon such cessation, without any further action on my part.

I hereby revoke all previous Powers of Attorney that have been granted by me in
connection with my reporting obligations, if any, under Section 16 of the
Exchange Act and Rule 144 under the Securities Act with respect to my holdings
of and transactions in securities issued by the Company.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have caused this Power of Attorney to be duly executed as
of this 28th day of December, 2022.

/s/ Thomas Krywe
