        <footnote id="F1">On March 15, 2022, the Reporting Person was granted restricted stock units, the vesting of which was subject to both performance-based and service-based criteria (&quot;PSUs&quot;). The number of shares reported represents the number of PSUs that were earned as a result of the achievement of such performance criteria.  Such earned PSUs will vest as to service as to 1/4 of the shares on March 1, 2023 and 1/12 of the remaining shares on each June 1, September 1, December 1 and March 1 thereafter, subject in each case to the Reporting Person remaining in Continuous Service (as defined in the Issuer's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan) of the issuer as of each such date.</footnote>
