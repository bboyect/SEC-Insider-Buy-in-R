SECTION 16

POWER OF ATTORNEY

Rachel Anna Schluter

The undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints the individuals named on
Schedule A attached hereto and as may be amended from time to time, or any of
them signing singly, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, the
undersigned's true and lawful attorney in fact to:

1.	as may be required, prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the
undersigned's behalf, and submit to the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the
undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

2.	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
as a Section 16 reporting person of the applicable registered investment
companies and business development companies (and any successor companies)
listed on Schedule A attached hereto, as amended from time to time, and any
other registered investment company or business development company affiliated
with or established by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), for
which the undersigned becomes a Section 16 reporting person (each, a "Fund"),
Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the
rules thereunder;

3.	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5,
complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such
form with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

4.	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing
which, in the opinion of such attorney in fact, may be of benefit to, in the
best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being understood
that the documents executed by such attorney in fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney in fact may approve in such
attorney in fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney in fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney in fact, or such attorney in fact's substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the
rights and powers herein granted.

The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys in fact, in serving in
such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming, nor is any
Fund assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section
16 of the Exchange Act.

This Power of Attorney may be executed in written form, by facsimile or by other
means using electronic or digital technology, whether it is a computer-generated
signature, an electronic copy of the party's true ink signature or otherwise.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by any Fund,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys in fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 10th day of January, 2023.
