    <footnotes>
        <footnote id="F1">On February 23, 2023, because the Issuer had not completed a business combination within 24 months of the closing of its initial public offering on February 12, 2021, as required by its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the Issuer redeemed all issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares (&quot;Class A Shares&quot;) at a per share redemption price of $10.18941393. On February 21, 2023, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) to delist the Issuer's securities. As a result, the Class A Shares, as well as the Issuer's publicly traded units and warrants, ceased trading as of close of business on February 21, 2023. The Issuer is expected to file a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of the securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Upon the effectiveness of the Form 15, the reporting person will cease to have a reporting obligation with respect to the Issuer's securities.</footnote>
