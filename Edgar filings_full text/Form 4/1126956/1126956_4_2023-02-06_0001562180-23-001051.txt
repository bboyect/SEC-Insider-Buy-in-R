(2) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigneds capacity
as a reporting person of Spire Inc. (the Company), Forms 3, 4 and 5 in
accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules thereunder (the Act);

(3)do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned that
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4 or 5,
complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such
form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock
exchange or similar authority; and

(4)take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing that, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of
the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and
shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve
in such attorney-in-facts discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might

revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact,
or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or
cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and
powers herein granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing

undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the
