			POWER OF ATTORNEY


      KNOW BY ALL THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned hereby

undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the
	undersigned's behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities
	and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including
	amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or
	appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the
	undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC of
	reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

(2)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
	undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of
	The Allstate Corporation (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5
	in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder; and any other forms
	or reports the undersigned may be required to file in
	connection with the undersigned's ownership, acquisition,
	or disposition of securities of the Company;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the
	undersigned which may be necessary or desirable to complete
	and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5, or other form or
	report, and timely file such form or report with the SEC
	and any stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection
	with the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-
	in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or
	legally required by, the undersigned, it being understood
	that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on
	behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney
	shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and
	conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
	attorney-in-fact's discretion.

      The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact
full power and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing
whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of
any of the rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and
purposes as the undersigned might or could do if personally present, with
full power of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming
all that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or
substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power
of attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  The undersigned
acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such
capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming, nor is
the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to
comply with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


      This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect
until the undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with
respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities
issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a
signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of
Attorney to be executed as of this 23rd day of February 2023.
