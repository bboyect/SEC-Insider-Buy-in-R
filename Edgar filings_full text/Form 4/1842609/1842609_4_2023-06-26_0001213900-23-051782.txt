In connection with the liquidation and dissolution of the Issuer, the reporting persons surrendered to the Issuer, for no consideration 6,899,999 Class B ordinary shares.</footnote>

Accordingly, each of Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Sternlicht (who also serve on the issuer's board of directors) and Mr. Aberle may be deemed to share dispositive power over the securities held by Juggernaut Sponsor. Because of the relationship among the Reporting Persons, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own the securities reported herein to the extent of their respective pecuniary interests. Each Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of any securities reported herein except to the extent of such entity's or such person's pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
