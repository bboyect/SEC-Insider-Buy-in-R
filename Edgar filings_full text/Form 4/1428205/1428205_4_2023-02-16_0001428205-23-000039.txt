        <footnote id="F1">The reporting person was granted an aggregate of 40,000 phantom shares under ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.'s (&quot;ARMOUR&quot;) Third Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to the time-based vesting schedule as follows. 2,000 phantom shares will vest on February 20, 2023 with an additional 2,000 phantom shares vesting on each following May 20, August 20, November 20 and February 20, through November 20, 2027, at which time all phantom stock shall have vested. Upon vesting, the reporting person will be entitled to an equal number of shares of ARMOUR common stock within 30 days.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The reporting person's unvested phantom stock will fully and automatically vest upon the reporting person's death, disability, and in the event of a change in control of ARMOUR. Upon termination of the reporting person's service with ARMOUR, all unvested phantom stock shall be forfeited by the reporting person. In the event of a resignation or retirement, provided the sum of the reporting person's age and years of service is equal to or greater than 70, the reporting person will retain his or her unvested stock awards which will remain subject to the vesting schedule set forth in this report, subject to satisfactory continuing fulfillment of certain conditions and related tax consequences and risks specified in the reporting person's grant agreement.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The reporting person also has the right to elect to have withholding taxes or a portion thereof, as the case may be, satisfied by reducing the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the reporting person by some or all of such shares. With respect to each phantom share, the reporting person will receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the cash dividend distributions paid in the ordinary course on a share of ARMOUR common stock. The reporting person also has the right to elect in lieu of the cash dividend payment a number of shares of common stock equal to the dividend payment payable divided by the fair market value of a share of ARMOUR common stock on the date of the dividend payment.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">Each unit of phantom stock is the economic equivalent of one share of ARMOUR common stock.</footnote>
