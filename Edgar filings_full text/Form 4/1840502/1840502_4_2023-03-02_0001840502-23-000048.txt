The RSUs shall vest in equal quarterly installments through 2027, subject to the Reporting Person's provision of service to the Issuer on each vesting date. The RSUs will not convert to ordinary shares until the satisfaction of an additional time-based settlement condition to occur on or after two years and one day following the date of grant. The settlement is not conditioned on the Reporting Person's provision of service on settlement date. Each RSU represents the right to receive one ordinary share upon vesting and settlement.</footnote>

        <footnote id="F3">Includes 1,237,215 vested Restricted Share Units (&quot;RSUs&quot;). The RSUs will not convert to ordinary shares until the satisfaction of additional time-based settlement conditions to occur in three variable installments during 2023.

        <footnote id="F5">In November 2022, the Reporting Person irrevocably conveyed his rights to direct the transfer of the reported shares or their proceeds, in each case including the shares underlying RSUs and share options, to a trust for which the Reporting Person's spouse is the sole beneficiary. The Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership for the purpose of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&quot;Section 16&quot;), except to the extent of his indirect pecuniary interest, if any, and his dispositive power, if any, therein. This report shall not be deemed an admission that such shares are beneficially owned by him for Section 16 or any other purpose.</footnote>
