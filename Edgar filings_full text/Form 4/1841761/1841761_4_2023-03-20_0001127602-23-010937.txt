        <footnote id="F1">The reporting person's purchase of Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. Class A common stock reported herein was matchable under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to the extent of 11,700 shares, with (i) the reporting person's sale of 6,900 shares of Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $1.2551 per share on November 14, 2022 and (ii) with the reporting person's sale of 4,800 shares of Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $1.2511 per share on November 15, 2022. However, the reporting person previously disgorged to Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc., $10,698 representing the full amount of the profit realized in connection with the short-swing transaction.  Because the transactions reported herein occurred at a weighted average price higher than $.3391, these transactions did not generate any additional profits subject to disgorgement to Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The transaction was executed in multiple trades in prices ranging from $.3322 to $.4068, inclusive. The price reported in Column 4 above reflects the weighted average purchase price. The Reporting person hereby undertakes to provide to the Securities and Exchange Commission staff, the Issuer, or a security holder of the Issuer, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares purchased at each respective price within the range set forth in this footnote of this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">These securities are directly held by The Landesberg Living Trust, dated October 15, 2021, for which the Reporting Person and his spouse serve as co-trustees.</footnote>
