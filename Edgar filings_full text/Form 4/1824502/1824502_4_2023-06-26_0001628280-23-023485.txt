        <footnote id="F1">Each restricted stock unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock, subject to the reporting person's continued service to the Issuer as of the applicable vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">All of the restricted stock units vest on the earlier of the:  (i) one year anniversary of the grant date or (ii) date of the Issuer's 2024 annual stockholders' meeting.  On the vesting date, pursuant to the reporting person's election, the restricted stock units will automatically convert into an equal number of deferred stock units, which will be settled for an equal number of shares of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.  Notwithstanding the aforementioned deferral period, from and after the vesting date, the deferred stock units may automatically settle earlier upon the reporting person's death, disability, or separation from service with the Issuer, or upon the occurrence of an &quot;unforeseeable emergency,&quot; as that term is defined under the deferred compensation program.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The restricted stock units do not expire; they either will vest on the vesting date and settle for shares at the end of the deferral period or they will be cancelled prior to the vesting date in the event the reporting person ceases to provide services to the Issuer.</footnote>
