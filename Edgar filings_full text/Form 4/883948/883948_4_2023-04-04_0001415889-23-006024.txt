        <footnote id="F1">Each share of phantom stock is the economic equivalent of one share of common stock. The shares of phantom stock become payable, in cash or common stock, at the election of the reporting person, upon the reporting person's termination of service as a director; provided, that if the reporting person elected to receive distributions under the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan in installments, such amounts are payable only in cash.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes additional shares acquired through dividend reinvestment since the reporting person's last Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Includes 5,267.78 shares previously reported by the reporting person in Table I as common stock indirectly held by Trustee of Non-Qualified Plan (deferred comp).  Such number of shares are phantom stock received under the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan that may be settled in cash, were inadvertently reported in Table I instead of Table II, and will no longer be reported by the reporting person as common stock in Table I.</footnote>
