        <footnote id="F1">Each Performance Share Unit (PSU) represents a contingent right to receive one share of JPMC common stock upon vesting based on the attainment of performance goals.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents PSUs earned (including reinvested dividend equivalents) based on the Firm's attainment of pre-established performance goals for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022. The PSUs are expected to vest and settle in shares of common stock on March 25, 2023, which will be reported in a later Form 4 filing. In accordance with the terms of the PSUs, the Board's Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee has certified the Firm's absolute and relative performance against the pre-established performance goals for the performance period and has determined that the maximum amount of the previously granted PSUs has been earned.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Shares delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of five years from the date of grant, as provided under the terms of the PSU award granted on January 21, 2020.</footnote>
