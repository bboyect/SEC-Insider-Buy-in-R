        <footnote id="F1">Each Performance Share Unit (PSU) represents a contingent right to receive one share of JPMC common stock upon vesting based on the attainment of performance goals.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents PSUs earned based on the Firm's attainment of pre-established performance goals for the 3-year performance period ended Dec. 31, 2022. Mr. Pinto's PSUs are expected to vest in 5 equal installments and will settle on: Mar. 25, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 and will be reported in Form 4 filings. In accordance with the terms of the PSUs, the Board's Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee (CMDC) has certified the Firm's absolute and relative performance against the pre-established performance goals for the performance period and has determined that the maximum amount of the previously granted PSUs has been earned. Under rules applicable in the U.K., Mr. Pinto's PSU award is subject to an assessment of his qualitative performance in determining the ultimate number of PSUs that will vest. As such, the CMDC has determined that no downward adjustment will be made to his payout on his qualitative performance during the performance period.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Shares delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional holding period following the vesting of each installment as provided under the terms of the PSU award granted on January 21, 2020: (i) a two-year holding period for the installment vesting on March 25, 2023; and (ii) a twelve-month holding period for installments vesting on March 25, 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027.</footnote>
