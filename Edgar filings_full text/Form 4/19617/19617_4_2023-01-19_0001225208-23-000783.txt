        <footnote id="F1">Each Restricted Stock Unit (&quot;RSU&quot;) represents a contingent right to receive one share of JPMC common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy which applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financial statements. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2023 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards granted to the Reporting Person are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Restricted stock units vest 50% on January 13, 2025 and 50% on January 13, 2026.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">Balance of 20,398 also includes (1) the remaining 4,200 RSUs of the previously reported January 2022 RSU grant of 5,600 shares which vests as follows: 1,400 shares on January 13, 2023, 1,400 shares on January 13, 2024, 1,400 shares on January 13, 2025, and 1,400 shares on January 13, 2026. As Identified Staff (material risk-takers identified under U.K. and/or European Union standards) for a portion of the year to which the grant relates, the shares resulting from vesting must be held for 12 months from vesting date; and (2) the remaining 4,622 RSUs of the previously reported January 2019 RSU grant of 7,702 shares which vests as follows: 1,540 shares on January 13, 2022, 1,540 shares on January 13, 2023, 1,540 shares on January 13, 2024, 1,541 shares on January 13, 2025, and 1,541 shares on January 13, 2026.
