        <footnote id="F1">The transaction reported represents the receipt by the Reporting Person of an in-kind distribution, for no consideration, of shares of common stock of the Issuer from Bespoke Sponsor Capital LP.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes 168,776 shares of common stock that were previously reported as being indirectly owned by the Reporting Person.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Due to an administrative error, the Reporting Person's previous Form 4 erroneously stated that the Reporting Person was granted 10,478 shares of restricted stock. The Reporting Person was granted 10,478 restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;). The 10,478 RSUs vest on 11/30/2023.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The transaction reported represents the receipt by the Reporting Person of an in-kind distribution, for no consideration, of warrants to purchase common stock of the Issuer from Bespoke Sponsor Capital LP.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">Includes 28,702 warrants to purchase common stock of the Issuer that were previously reported as being indirectly held by the Reporting Person.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>Effective March 31, 2023, the Reporting Person is no longer a managing member of Bespoke Capital Partners, LLC, the general partner of Bespoke Sponsor Capital LP (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;), and thus, the Reporting Person no longer may be deemed to have beneficial ownership over the securities owned by the Sponsor.</remarks>
