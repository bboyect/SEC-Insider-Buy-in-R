        <footnote id="F1">On May 18, 2023, the reporting person received a grant of restricted units (the &quot;Restricted Units&quot;) of Vornado Realty L.P. (the &quot;Operating Partnership&quot;), the operating partnership of Vornado Realty Trust (the &quot;Company&quot;). The Restricted Units are a class of units of the Operating Partnership that following the occurrence of certain events are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of Class A Units of the Operating Partnership. Class A Units are redeemable by the holder for cash or, at the Company's election, common shares of beneficial interest, $0.04 par value per share (the &quot;Common Shares&quot;) of the Company on a one for one basis or the cash value of such shares.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These Restricted Units vest immediately. These units are not transferable until the reporting person is no longer serving as a member of the Company's Board of Trustees, other than in connection with a conversion of the Restricted Units to Class A Units and a redemption of such Class A Units for Common Shares. Any Common Shares issued in connection with such a redemption must be held by the reporting person until such person is no longer a member of the Company's Board of Trustees.</footnote>
