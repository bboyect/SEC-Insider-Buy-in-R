        <footnote id="F1">Represents LTIP Units of Vornado Realty L.P. (the &quot;Operating Partnership&quot;), the operating partnership of Vornado Realty Trust (the &quot;Company&quot;). The LTIP Units are a class of units of the Operating Partnership that following the occurrence of certain events and upon vesting are convertible by the holder into an equivalent number of Class A Units of the Operating Partnership (&quot;Class A Units&quot;). Class A Units of the Operating Partnership are redeemable by the holder for cash or, at the Company's election, common shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares. The rights to convert LTIP Units into Class A Units and redeem Class A Units do not have expiration dates.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The LTIP Units were originally issued in January 2022 that were subject to performance-based vesting hurdles based on achievement of operational performance metrics for the year ended December 31, 2022, and which remain subject to certain additional performance-based vesting hurdles based on the Company's total shareholder return for the period from January 12, 2022 through January 12, 2025 (the &quot;TSR Performance Period&quot;). On April 5, 2023, the Company's Compensation Committee determined the level of achievement of the operational performance-based vesting hurdles for these LTIP Units, resulting in the number of LTIP Units reported initially being earned, which amount may be adjusted downwards by up to 30.0% at the conclusion of the TSR Performance Period based on the Company's total shareholder return.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Earned LTIP Units will vest in equal installments on each of January 12, 2025 and January 12, 2026, subject to continued employment. Each LTIP and Class A Unit acquired upon conversion of such LTIP Unit is subject to an additional one-year transfer restriction pursuant to which such LTIP Unit and Class A Unit generally may not be transferred, and the redemption right associated with the Class A Unit may not be exercised until one year after the vesting date.</footnote>
