   Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby
constitutes and appoints each of:

(a) Jonathan J. Doyle, Kary Bahr and Beth Suzanski, or any
of them signing singly, and with full power of substitution,
the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

1) prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the
undersigned's behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments
thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate to
obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to make
electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Section 16"),
Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Rule 144"),
or any other rule or regulation of the SEC;

2) execute, for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the
undersigned's capacity as an officer and/or director of Raymond
James Financial, Inc. (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in
accordance with Section 16 and the rules thereunder, and any other
forms or reports the undersigned may be required to file in
connection with the undersigned's ownership, acquisition or
disposition of securities of the Company;

(b) Kelly Peterson, Mario Esposito, Tracey Cornelison, Mohammed
Alshatri and Melissa Fisher, in his or her capacity as a duly
authorized representative of Raymond James & Associates, Inc.,
a Florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(the "Broker"), or any of them signing singly, and with full power of
substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned any Notice of
Proposed Sale of Securities on Form 144 ("Form 144"), and any
amendments thereto pursuant to Rule 144, and timely file such
Form 144 with the SEC, in connection with the undersigned's
disposition of securities of the Company; and

2) seek or obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the
undersigned's behalf, information on transactions in securities of
the Company from any third party, including brokers (including the
Broker), employee benefit plan administrators and trustees, and the
undersigned hereby authorizes any such person to release any such
information to each of the undersigned's attorneys-in-fact appointed
by this Power of Attorney, and hereby approves and ratifies any such
release of such information; and

(c) with respect to each of (a) and (b) hereinabove:

1) do and perform any and all further acts, for and on behalf of the
undersigned, which may be necessary or desirable to complete and
execute any such Form 3, 4 and 5, Form 144, or other form or report,
complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely
file such form or report with the SEC and, where applicable, the New
York Stock Exchange or similar authority; and

2) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with
the foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may
be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required of,
the undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by
such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this
Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such
terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

   The undersigned hereby further grants to each such
attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and perform any
and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper
to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers herein
granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned
might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute
or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
of this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.

   The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing
attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of
the undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company or the
Broker assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to
comply with Section 16, Rule 144, or the respective rules and
regulations thereunder ("Law").  The undersigned further
acknowledges that it is his/her responsibility to provide
information to the attorneys-in-fact on a timely basis with
respect to any proposed transaction that could require the
filing of any Form 4 or 5, or Form 144, and to respond in a
timely manner to all communications, notices and inquiries
from the attorneys-in-fact, the Company or the Broker, or their
respective representatives, with respect to any proposed
transaction.  The undersigned further acknowledges that
failure to provide information on a timely basis, or to
respond in a timely manner to such notices, communications
and inquiries, could result in the failure to make timely
filing of these documents as required by Law, which could
result in violations of Law by the undersigned, as well as
public disclosure of delinquent filings by the undersigned.
The undersigned further acknowledges that the responsibility
for timely filing continues to be that of the undersigned and,
in that regard, releases the attorneys-in-fact, the Company
and the Broker from any liability with respect to any action
taken or omitted in good faith by them in connection with
such filings.

   This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and
effect until the undersigned is no longer required to file
Forms 3, 4 and 5, or Form 144, with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities
issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the
undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the foregoing
attorneys-in-fact.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of
Attorney to be executed this 8th day of May, 2023.
