        <footnote id="F1">On March 7, 2023, the Issuer announced that it will not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required. In connection with the winding up of the Issuer, the Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, held by the Reporting Persons were canceled on March 27, 2023.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">New Emerging Markets Horizon (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) was the record holder of such Class B ordinary shares. FPP Capital Advisers is the sole managing member of the Sponsor and had sole voting and dispositive control over the Class B ordinary shares held of record by the Sponsor. Therefore FPP Capital Advisers may also have been deemed to be the beneficial owner of such shares. FPP Capital Advisers disclaims any beneficial ownership of the securities held by the Sponsor, other than to the extent of any pecuniary interest it may have therein, directly or indirectly.</footnote>
