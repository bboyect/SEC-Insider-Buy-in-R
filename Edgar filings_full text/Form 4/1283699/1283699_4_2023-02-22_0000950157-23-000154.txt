        <footnote id="F1">On May 21, 2021, Deutsche Telekom AG (&quot;DT&quot;) entered into a forward purchase contract (the &quot;Forward Contract&quot;) with an unaffiliated counterparty covering up to a maximum of 20,000,000 shares of the Issuer's common stock (the &quot;Shares&quot;). On August 24, 2021, the counterparty completed its initial hedge, and the number of Shares covered by the Forward Contract was fixed at 20,000,000. On February 22, 2023, DT entered into an early unwind agreement (the &quot;Unwind Agreement&quot;) that amended the terms of the Forward Contract to provide for the early cash settlement of the forward purchase of up to all of the Shares.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Unwind Agreement provides for an unwind period of 60 trading days, commencing on the date of the Unwind Agreement (the &quot;Unwind Period&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The settlement payment owed by the applicable party to the Unwind Agreement, if any, will be determined based on the volume-weighted average prices at which the applicable Shares are sold during the Unwind Period.</footnote>
