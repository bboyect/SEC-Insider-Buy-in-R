With respect to holdings of and transactions in securities issued by Mercato

      2.  execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, forms 3, 4, and 5 in

      4  take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
          foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
          benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
          undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such
