        <footnote id="F1">Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership, a New York Partnership (&quot;ANP&quot;) owns 194,023,290 shares and Advance Newhouse Partnership, a New York Partnership (&quot;A/N&quot;) owns 4,158,459 shares. The number of shares owned by A/N has been increased to reflect 6,157 shares received as an AT&amp;T, Inc. shareholder in connection with the transaction completed April 8, 2022, pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. combined with AT&amp;T, Inc.'s WarnerMedia business (the &quot;WarnerMedia Business&quot;) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction and Discovery, Inc. became the parent entity of the combined Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia Business. Mr. Newhouse, by virtue of his affiliations with Advance Publications, Inc. (&quot;API&quot;), Newhouse Broadcasting Corporation (&quot;NBCo&quot;), and certain holders of equity in API and NBCo, may be deemed to beneficially own shares of the Company owned directly by A/N and ANP. API and NBCo indirectly own all of the partnership interests of A/N and ANP.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Mr. Newhouse disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock owned by A/N and ANP and this report shall not be deemed an admission that Mr. Newhouse is the beneficial owner of such shares for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</footnote>
