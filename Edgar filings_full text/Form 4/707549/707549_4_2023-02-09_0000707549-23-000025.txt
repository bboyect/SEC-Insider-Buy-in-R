(2) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity as an officer
and/or director of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in
accordance with Section 16(a) and the rules thereunder;



(3) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which may be

(4) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing which, in the
opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally
required by, the undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by such

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and authority to do and
