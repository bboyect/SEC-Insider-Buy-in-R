        <footnote id="F1">Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 15, 2022 by and among the Issuer, Rattler Midstream LP (&quot;Rattler&quot;), Rattler Midstream GP LLC, the general partner of Rattler, and Bacchus Merger Sub Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), on August 24, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Rattler, with Rattler surviving as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer (the &quot;Merger&quot;). At the effective time of the Merger, (i) each outstanding Rattler common unit held by the Reporting Person was converted into the right to receive 0.113 shares (the &quot;Exchange Ratio&quot;) of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&quot;Common Stock&quot;), of the Issuer and (ii) each outstanding Rattler phantom unit held by the Reporting Person was converted into the right to receive the Issuer's restricted stock units, as adjusted by the Exchange Ratio, with the same vesting schedule and other terms and conditions as the corresponding Rattler phantom units.</footnote>
