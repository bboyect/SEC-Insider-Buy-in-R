and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	complete, sign, and submit to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission Forms 3, 4 and 5 (including any amendments thereto)
in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules thereunder, including with respect to any and all
equity securities issued by the Company that may be considered to be owned
by the undersigned for the purposes of such statute and rules;

(2)	complete, sign, and submit to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, for and on behalf of the undersigned, Form 144
(including any amendments thereto) in accordance with the Securities Act
of 1933 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to file any such Form 3, 4, 5 or 144, or
any amendments thereto, with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission and any other authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit
to, in the best interest of or legally required of the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of
the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and

	The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full
power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing whatsoever

of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless earlier
revoked by the undersigned in a subsequently executed Power of Attorney or a
signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney
