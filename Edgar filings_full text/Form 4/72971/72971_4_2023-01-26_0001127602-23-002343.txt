                         POWER OF ATTORNEY

constitutes and appoints solely in connection with the undersigned's
capacity as an officer and/or director of Wells Fargo & Company (the
"Company"), each of Anne M. Daniel, Brad D. Kern, Janet McGinness,
Tangela Richter, and Peter Skrief, acting alone, the undersigned's true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	complete, sign, and submit to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission Forms 3, 4 and 5 (including any amendments thereto)
in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and the rules thereunder, including with respect to any and all
equity securities issued by the Company that may be considered to be owned
by the undersigned for the purposes of such statute and rules;

(2)	complete, sign, and submit to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, for and on behalf of the undersigned, Form 144
(including any amendments thereto) in accordance with the Securities Act
of 1933 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to file any such Form 3, 4, 5 or 144, or
any amendments thereto, with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission and any other authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit
to, in the best interest of or legally required of the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of
the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and
shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve
in his or her discretion.

	The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full
power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present and acting, with full
power of substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that such attorney-in-fact, or his or her substitute or substitutes, shall

the undersigned to comply with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, including Rule 144 thereunder.

	This Power of Attorney revokes any previous Power of Attorney granted
by the undersigned with respect to the subject matter hereof, and shall
remain in full force and effect until the undersigned is no longer required
to file Forms 3, 4, 5 and 144 with respect to the undersigned's holdings
of and transactions in securities issued by the Company, unless earlier
revoked by the undersigned in a subsequently executed Power of Attorney or a
signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney
to be executed as of this 6th day of September, 2022.
