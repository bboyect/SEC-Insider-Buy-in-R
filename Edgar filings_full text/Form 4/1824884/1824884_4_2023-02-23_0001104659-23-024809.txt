        <footnote id="F1">The Class A Ordinary Shares were disposed of as a result of Yakira Capital Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &quot;Reporting Person&quot;), exercising its right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the issuer's trust account.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Reporting Person serves as investment advisors to each of (i) Yakira Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&quot;Yakira Partners&quot;), (ii) Yakira Enhanced Offshore Fund Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (&quot;Yakira Offshore&quot;) and (iii) MAP 136 Segregated Portfolio, a Cayman Islands exempted company (&quot;MAP 136&quot;) and has sole voting and investment discretion with respects to the securities reported herein which are held by Yakira Partners, Yakira Offshore and MAP 136. The Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of the securities reported herein for the purpose of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purpose, except to the extent of Reporting Person's pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>The Reporting Person ceased to be a 10% owner effective February 15, 2023. As a result, the Reporting Person is no longer subject to Section 16 in connection with its transactions in the equity securities of the issuer and therefore will no longer report any such transactions on Form 4 or Form 5.</remarks>
