        <footnote id="F1">On February 4, 2020, Advance/Newhouse Partnership (&quot;A/N&quot;) established a credit facility backed by an equity collar transaction and an aggregate of 4,000,000 Class B Common Units of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (&quot;Units&quot;) to provide financial flexibility to support its ongoing estate planning and its investment program and for other general corporate purposes. A/N entered into Share Collar Transactions (the &quot;Transactions&quot;) with unaffiliated banks, pursuant to which A/N wrote European call options and purchased European put options over an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;) of Charter Communications, Inc. (the &quot;Issuer&quot;). Under the agreement, the Transactions may be settled in cash unless A/N elects physical settlement, in which case it expects to exchange Units for Class A Common Stock sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the Transactions.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">On March 17, 2023, A/N early terminated a portion of the Transactions, with expiration dates running from August 12, 2024 to September 5, 2024, inclusive, and an equivalent portion of the corresponding credit facility. The terminated Transactions covered 1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, and, in connection with this termination, 1,000,000 Units were released from the related pledge. Pursuant to this termination, the unaffiliated bank counterparty paid $93,694,100.00 in cash to A/N.</footnote>

    <remarks>Each of Newhouse Broadcasting Corporation, Advance Publications, Inc., Newhouse Family Holdings, L.P. and Advance Long-Term Management Trust may be deemed to beneficially own the call options and put options held by A/N and reported in Table II due to their control of A/N.</remarks>
