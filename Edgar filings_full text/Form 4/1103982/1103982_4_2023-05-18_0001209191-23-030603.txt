POWER OF ATTORNEY

Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints
Ellen M. Smith and Issa Yesufu, signing singly, the undersigned's true and
lawful attorney-in-fact to:
(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's behalf,
and submit to
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID, including
amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate to obtain
codes and
passwords enabling the undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC of
reports
required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or
regulation of
the SEC;
(2)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
as an executive
officer and/or director of Mondelez International, Inc. (the "Company"), Forms
3, 4 and 5 in
accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
rules
thereunder;
(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary
or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4 or 5, complete and
execute any
amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file such form with the SEC and any
stock
exchange or similar authority; and
(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the
opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the best interest of,
or legally
required by, the undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by
such
attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney
shall be in

in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.
The undersigned hereby grants to such attorney-in-fact full power and authority
to do and perform
any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite, necessary, or proper to be
done in the exercise of any of
the rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as
the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and
confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute
or substitutes, shall lawfully
do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the rights and
powers herein granted. The
undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorney-in-fact, in serving in such
capacity at the request
of the undersigned, is not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of the

This Power of Attorney is effective January 30, 2023 and revokes all prior
Powers of Attorney relating to
reporting under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of the

matters outlined above and shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required
to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the undersigned's holdings of and
transactions in securities issued
by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing
delivered to the foregoing
attorney-in-fact or in a subsequently filed instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this
2nd day of February, 2023.
