        <footnote id="F1">On May 11, 2023, the reporting person was granted an option (the &quot;Option&quot;) to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock of the Issuer (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;) as compensation for the reporting person's role as Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer. The Option will vest and become exercisable in five equal installments on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of May 5, 2023, subject to continued employment and subject to certain Stock Price Vesting Triggers (each, a &quot;Stock Price Vesting Trigger&quot;) as set forth below. For each of the five annual vesting tranches, the Stock Price Vesting Trigger will be deemed achieved as of the first date following May 11, 2023 that the 30 calendar-day trailing average of the trading price of the Common Stock (as measured by the volume-weighted average price) equals or exceeds:</footnote>
