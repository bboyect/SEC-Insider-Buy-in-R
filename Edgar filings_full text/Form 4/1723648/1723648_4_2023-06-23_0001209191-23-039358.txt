LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR
SECTION 16 REPORTING PURPOSES


	Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby makes, constitutes and
appoints each of Stephen Gregory Clevenger and Aaron Ross, each of LiveVox
Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"), acting individually, as the undersigned's true
and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority as hereinafter
described on behalf of and in the name, place and stead of the undersigned to:

(1)	prepare and execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's
behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
Form ID, including amendments thereto, an Update Passphrase Request, and any
other documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling
the undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC;

(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form ID or Update
Passphrase Request and timely file such forms with the SEC or such States; and

(3)     execute for, and on behalf of, the undersigned, in the undersigned's
capacity as an officer and/or director of LiveVox Holdings, Inc. (the
"Company"), Forms 3, 4 and 5 relating to the Company in accordance with Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act");

(4)	seek or obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the undersigned's
behalf, information on transactions in the Company's securities from any third
party, including brokers, employee benefit plan administrators and trustees, and
the undersigned hereby authorizes any such person to release any such
information to any attorney-in-fact and further approves and ratifies any such
release of information;

(5)     do and perform any and all acts for, and on behalf of, the undersigned
that may be necessary or desirable to prepare, complete and execute any such
Form 3, 4, or 5, and any amendments thereto, or other required report and timely
file such forms or reports with the SEC, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and any
stock exchange or similar authority as considered necessary or advisable under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act; and

(6)     take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing that, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Limited Power of Attorney shall be in such form and
shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in
such attorney-in-fact's sole discretion.

The undersigned hereby acknowledges that (a) the foregoing attorneys-in-fact are
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned; (b) this Limited
Power of Attorney authorizes, but does not require, each such attorney-in-fact
to act in his or her discretion on information provided to such attorney-in-fact
without independent verification of such information; (c) any documents prepared
and/or executed by any attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to
this Limited Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such
information and disclosure as such attorney-in-fact, in his or her sole
discretion, deems necessary or advisable; (d) neither the Company nor any
attorney-in-fact assumes (i) any liability for the undersigned's responsibility
to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) any liability of the
undersigned for any failure to comply with such requirements or (iii) any
obligation or liability of the undersigned for profit disgorgement under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act; and (e) this Limited Power of Attorney does not
relieve the undersigned from responsibility for compliance with the
undersigned's obligations under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation,
the reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

This Limited Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of, and transactions in, securities issued by the
Company, unless earlier revoked as to any attorney-in-fact by the undersigned in
a signed writing delivered to such attorney-in-fact.


	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 22nd day of June 2023.
