        <footnote id="F1">On June 22, 2023, the Issuer announced that its board of directors had determined to redeem all of its outstanding shares of Class A common stock sold in the Issuer's initial public offering (the &quot;Public Shares&quot;), effective as of June 22, 2023, because the Issuer will not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As of the close of business on June 22, 2023, the Public Shares were deemed cancelled and represented only the rights to receive the per-share redemption price. In connection with the redemption of the Public Shares and anticipated dissolution of the Issuer, on July 17, 2023, Forum Investors IV LLC (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) forfeited to the Issuer for no consideration 8,400,377 shares of Class B common stock and 834,023 shares of Class A common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Sponsor is the record holder of the shares reported herein. Marshall Kiev and David Boris are the managing members of Forum Capital Management IV LLC, which is the managing member of the Sponsor. As such, Forum Capital Management IV LLC, David Boris and Marshall Kiev may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the securities held directly by the Sponsor. Each such entity or person disclaims any beneficial ownership of the reported shares other than to the extent of any pecuniary interest they may have therein, directly or indirectly.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The shares of Class B common stock were convertible for shares of the Issuer's Class A common stock at the time of the Issuer's initial business combination as described under the heading &quot;Description of Securities&quot; in the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-253216) (the &quot;Registration Statement&quot;) and had no expiration date.</footnote>
