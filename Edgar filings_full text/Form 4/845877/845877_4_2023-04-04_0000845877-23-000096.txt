        <footnote id="F1">On March 31, 2023, (i) 1,573 restricted stock units vested as the third installment of the time-based award granted in March 2020, for which the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (&quot;Farmer Mac&quot;) retained 760 shares to satisfy withholding requirements, (ii) 2,600 performance-based restricted stock units vested that were granted in March 2020 (2,359 target units vesting at a 110.1884% performance factor), for which Farmer Mac retained 1,256 shares to satisfy withholding requirements, (iii) 2,065 restricted stock units vested as the second installment of the time-based award granted in March 2021, for which Farmer Mac retained 998 shares to satisfy withholding requirements, and (iv) 1,355 restricted stock units vested as the first installment of the time-based award granted in March 2022, for which Farmer Mac retained 655 shares to satisfy withholding requirements.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">In accordance with a policy adopted by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of Farmer Mac's Board of Directors, the price used for the calculation of the number of shares withheld by Farmer Mac in satisfaction of tax liability is the closing price of Farmer Mac's Class C Non-Voting Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day before the vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Includes 31,426 unvested restricted stock units previously granted pursuant to Farmer Mac's Amended and Restated 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The grants of restricted stock units have been described in detail in Farmer Mac's prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The total amount of securities beneficially owned has been adjusted since the Reporting Person's last filing to reflect 241 more shares that vested on March 31, 2023 as a result of applying a 110.1884% performance factor to 2,359 target restricted stock units granted in March 2020.</footnote>
