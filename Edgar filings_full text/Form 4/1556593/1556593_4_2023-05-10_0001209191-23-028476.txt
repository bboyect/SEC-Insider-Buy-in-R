POWER OF ATTORNEY


       KNOW ALL BY THESE PRESENT, that the undersigned hereby constitutes,
designates and appoints Philip Sivin and Nicola Santoro, Jr. as such person's
true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, each with full power of
substitution and resubstitution and full power to act alone and without the
other, for the undersigned and in the undersigned's name, place and stead, in
any and all capacities, to:

       (1)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
capacity as an officer and/or director of Rithm Capital Corp. (the "Company"),
any and all Forms 3, 4 and 5 (including any amendments thereto) required to be
filed by the undersigned in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), and the rules and regulations
thereunder;

       (2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4
or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely file
such form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock
exchange or similar authority; and

       (3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned, pursuant to this Power of Attorney, shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

       The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power
and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of Attorney and the
rights and powers herein granted.  The undersigned acknowledges that no such
attorney-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned,
is hereby assuming, nor is the Company hereby assuming, any of the undersigned's
responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the Act.

       This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to
be executed as of this 13th day of February, 2023.
