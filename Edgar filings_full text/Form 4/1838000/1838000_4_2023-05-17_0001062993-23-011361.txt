Each of the three managing members has one vote, and the approval of at least two of the three is required for approval of an action of the entity. Each of Messrs. Gruschka, Greystoke, and Kilambi disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities held by Sponsor, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
