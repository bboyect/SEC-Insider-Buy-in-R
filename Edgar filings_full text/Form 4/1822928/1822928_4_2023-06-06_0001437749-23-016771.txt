        <footnote id="F2">Represents a grant of performance-based restricted stock units made as an inducement award outside of the Issuer's 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan in connection with the Reporting Person's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer. Each performance-based restricted stock unit represents a contingent right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Common Stock. These performance-based restricted stock units will be eligible to vest in tranches based on the Company's closing stock price meeting or exceeding the stock price target specified for each tranche for a period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to December 31, 2030. Once the stock price performance goal for a tranche is achieved, the portion of the award related to that tranche will vest, subject to the reporting person's continued service on such date.</footnote>
