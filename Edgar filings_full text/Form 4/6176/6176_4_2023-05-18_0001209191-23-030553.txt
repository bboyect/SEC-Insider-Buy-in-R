   Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby makes, constitutes
and appoints each of Kimberly P. Knox, Michael G. McAuley, J. Brett McBrayer
and Seth Popick, Esquire, or either of them
acting singly, and with full power of substitution and re-substitution, the
undersigned's true  and lawful Attorney-in-Fact (each of such persons and their
substitutes being referred to herein as the "Attorney-in-Fact"), with full power
to act for the undersigned and in the undersigned's name, place and stead, in
any and all capacities, to:
1.	Prepare, execute, and submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other documents
necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned
to make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required or considered by the
Attorney-in-Fact to be advisable under Section 13 or Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or any rule or regulation
of the SEC;
2.	Prepare, execute and submit to the SEC, Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the
"Company"), and/or any national securities exchange on which the Company's
securities are listed any and all reports (including any amendments thereto) the
undersigned is required to file with the SEC, or which the Attorney-in-Fact
considers it advisable to file with the SEC, under Section 13 or Section 16 of
the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, or under Rule 144 under
the Securities Act of 1933 ("Rule 144"), with respect to the any security of the
Company, including Forms 3, 4 and 5, Schedules 13D and 13G, and Forms 144; and
3.	Obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the undersigned's behalf,
information regarding transactions in the Company's equity securities from any
third party, including the Company and any brokers, dealers, employee benefit

	The undersigned acknowledges that:
a)	This Power of Attorney authorizes, but does not require, the Attorney-in-Fact
to act in his or her discretion on information provided to such Attorney-in-Fact
without independent verification of such information;
b)	Any documents prepared or executed by the Attorney-in-Fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney will be in such form and will
contain such information as the Attorney-in-Fact, in his or her discretion,
deems necessary or desirable;
c)	Neither the Company nor the Attorney-in-Fact assumes any liability for the
undersigned's responsibility to comply with the requirements of Section 13 or

any failure to comply with such requirements, or any liability of the
undersigned for disgorgement of profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act;
and
d)	This Power of Attorney does not relieve the undersigned from responsibility
for compliance with the undersigned's obligations under Section 13 or Section 16

	The undersigned hereby grants to the Attorney-in-Fact full power and authority
to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite, necessary or advisable
to be done in connection with the foregoing, as fully, to all intents and
purposes, as the undersigned might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and
confirming all that the Attorney-in-Fact, or his or her substitute or
substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by authority of this Power of
Attorney.
	This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 4 or 5 or Schedules 13D or 13G
or Forms 144 with respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in
securities of the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed
writing delivered to the Attorney-in-Fact. This Power of Attorney revokes all
previous powers of attorney with respect to the subject matter of this Power of
Attorney.
	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Power of Attorney as of
