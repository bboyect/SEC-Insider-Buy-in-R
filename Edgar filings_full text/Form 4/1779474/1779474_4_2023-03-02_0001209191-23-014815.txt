Date:  4/14/2021

Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints
Arden Lee and Brian Camire of WM Technology, Inc. (the "Company") and Ron
Metzger, Kris Cachia and Michael Suyat of Cooley LLP, or any of them signing
singly, and with full power of substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to:

1.	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's behalf,
and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form ID,
including amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate
to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to make electronic
filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

2.	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned with respect to the Company,
Schedules 13D and 13G and Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Sections 13 and
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

3.	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Schedules 13D or
13G or Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto, and timely file such form with the SEC and any stock exchange or
similar authority; and

4.	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the foregoing
which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to, in the
best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being understood
that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply
with Sections 13 and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of the date first written above.

/s/  Scott Gordon
