        <footnote id="F1">The reported transaction relates to the reporting person's receipt of 208,623 restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) as the reporting person's 2023 annual equity award grant for service as a non-employee member of the issuer's Board of Directors, of which 104,312 vested on May 24, 2023 (the date of grant), and 104,311 will vest on the earlier of (i) the date of the first annual meeting of stockholders of the issuer occurring after the date of grant, or (ii) May 24, 2024.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the issuer's Class A common stock (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;). The RSUs will convert into shares of Common Stock upon vesting; provided, however, that if, on the conversion date, the reporting person is prohibited from trading in the issuer's securities pursuant to applicable securities laws or the issuer's policies, the conversion date shall be, in the determination of the Compensation Committee of the issuer's Board of Directors, the second trading day after the date the reporting person is no longer prohibited from trading.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Of this amount, 108,815 are unvested RSUs.</footnote>
