POWER OF ATTORNEY

	KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints Kevin Feeley, Bridget Brown and Eunkyung Lee as his or her true and
lawful attorney-in-fact to:

	(1)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
as a representative of Sema4 Holdings Corp. (the "Company"), any and all Form
ID, or Form 3, 4 or 5 reports and any amendments thereto required to be filed by
the undersigned in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules thereunder with respect to
transactions in the Company's securities;

	(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form ID, or Form
3, 4 or 5 report and any amendments thereto and timely file such reports with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or similar
authority; and

	(3)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned, pursuant to this Power of Attorney, shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney in-fact may approve in his or
her discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, and proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or his or her
substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of
this Power of Attorney and the rights and powers herein granted.  The
undersigned acknowledges that no such attorney in-fact, in serving in such
capacity at the request of the undersigned, is hereby assuming, nor is the
Company hereby assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply
with Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

The undersigned agrees that each such attorney-in-fact may rely entirely on
information furnished orally or in writing by the undersigned to each such
attorney-in-fact.  The undersigned also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and each such attorney-in-fact against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in these respects) that arise out of or are based on
any untrue statement or omission of necessary facts in the information provided
by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact for purposes of executing,
acknowledging, delivering and filing Forms 3, 4 or 5 (including amendments
thereto) and agrees to reimburse the Company and each such attorney-in-fact for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating
or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Form 3, 4 or 5 reports with respect to
the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the
Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered
to the foregoing attorneys in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 12th day of September, 2022.

/s/ Richard Pfenniger
