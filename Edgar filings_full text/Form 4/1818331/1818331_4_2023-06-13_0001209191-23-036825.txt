	(2)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which

the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the
Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered
to the foregoing attorneys in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
