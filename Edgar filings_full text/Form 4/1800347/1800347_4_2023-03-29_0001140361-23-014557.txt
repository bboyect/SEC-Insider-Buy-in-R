        <footnote id="F1">Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers LLC (&quot;NBIA&quot;) serves as investment adviser to each of Neuberger Berman Opportunistic Capital Solutions Master Fund LP (&quot;Master Fund&quot;) and NBOKS Co-Invest Fund I LP (&quot;Co-Invest Fund&quot;) and, in such capacity, exercises voting or investment power over the shares held directly by Master Fund and Co-Invest Fund. Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers Holdings LLC is the holding company of NBIA and a subsidiary of Neuberger Berman Group LLC.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Reflects a pro-rata, in-kind distribution of 7,625,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor LLC (&quot;Sponsor&quot;) to Master Fund on February 21, 2023, for no consideration.  Sponsor also distributed to Master Fund 5,140,000 warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock on February 21, 2023, pro-rata, in-kind and for no consideration.  Each transaction resulted solely in a change in Master Fund's form of ownership and thus was exempt from Section 16 pursuant to Rule 16a-13 under the Exchange Act.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Co-Invest Fund distributed these shares in-kind to its members on a pro-rata basis, for no consideration.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>Master Fund has the contractual right to designate two members to the Issuer's board of directors. Accordingly, each of the Reporting Persons is deemed to be a &quot;director by deputization&quot;, as such term is used for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, of the Issuer.</remarks>
