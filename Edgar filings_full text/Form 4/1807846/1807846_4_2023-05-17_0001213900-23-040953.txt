        <footnote id="F1">Represents shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &quot;Class A Common Stock&quot;), of MoneyLion Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) withheld to cover payment of the tax liabilities of the Reporting Person related to the vesting of 427 restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;). The acquisition of the RSUs was previously reported in Table I of the Reporting Person's Form 3 on April 5, 2022.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes RSUs, each of which represents a contingent right to receive one share of Class A Common Stock and the acquisition of which was previously reported by the Reporting Person.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>On April 24, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split (the &quot;Reverse Stock Split&quot;) of the Class A Common Stock pursuant to which every 30 shares of Class A Common Stock were automatically reclassified into one new share of Class A Common Stock. Proportionate adjustments were made to the Company's outstanding equity awards as well as the exercise, grant and acquisition prices of such equity awards, as applicable. Accordingly, all amounts of securities reported on this Form 4 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.</remarks>
