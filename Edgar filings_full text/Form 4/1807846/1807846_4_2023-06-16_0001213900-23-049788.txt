        <footnote id="F1">Represents the annual award of restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), each of which represents a contingent right to receive one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of MoneyLion Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;), automatically granted to the Reporting Person pursuant to the Company's Outside Director Compensation Program. 25% of the award will vest on September 15, 2023, 25% of the award will vest on December 15, 2023, 25% of the award will vest on March 15, 2024 and 25% of the award will vest on June 15, 2024, subject to the Reporting Person's continued service on the Company's Board of Directors on each vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes certain RSUs beneficially owned by the Reporting Person, the acquisitions of which were previously reported in Table I of the Reporting Person's Form 4s filed on March 16, 2022 and November 17, 2022.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>On April 24, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split (the &quot;Reverse Stock Split&quot;) of the Class A common stock pursuant to which every 30 shares of Class A common stock were automatically reclassified into one new share of Class A common stock. Proportionate adjustments were made to the Company's outstanding equity awards as well as the exercise, grant and acquisition prices of such equity awards, as applicable. Accordingly, all amounts of securities reported on this Form 4 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.</remarks>
