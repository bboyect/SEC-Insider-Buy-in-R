          Section 16 and Rule 144 Limited Power of Attorney

     Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby makes,
constitutes and appoints each of R. Patrick Quinn, Salvatore J. DiMartino,
Christine M. Reid and Jan M. Klym, or either of them acting singly, and with
full power of substitution and re-substitution, the undersigned's true  and
lawful attorney in fact (each of such persons and their substitutes being
referred to herein as the "Attorney-in-Fact"), with full power to act for
the undersigned and in the undersigned's name, place and stead, in any and
all capacities, to:

     (1) Prepare, execute, and submit to the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the
undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC of reports required or
considered by the Attorney-in-Fact to be advisable under Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or any rule or
regulation of the SEC;

     (2) Prepare, execute and submit to the SEC, New York Community Bancorp,
Inc. (the "Company"), and/or any national securities exchange on which the
Company's securities are listed any and all reports (including any amendments
thereto) the undersigned is required to file with the SEC, or which the
Attorney-in-Fact considers it advisable to file with the SEC, under Section 16
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, or under Rule 144
under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Rule 144"), with respect to any security
of the Company, including Forms 3, 4 and 5 and Forms 144; and

     (3) Obtain, as the undersigned's representative and on the undersigned's
behalf, information regarding transactions in the Company's equity securities
from any third party, including the Company and any brokers, dealers,
employee benefit plan administrators and trustees, and the undersigned hereby
authorizes any such third party to release any such information to the
Attorney-in-Fact.

The undersigned acknowledges that:

a) This Power of Attorney authorizes, but does not require, the
Attorney-in-Fact to act in his or her discretion on information provided to
such Attorney-in-Fact without independent verification of such information;

b) Any documents prepared or executed by the Attorney-in-Fact on behalf
of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney will be in such form
and will contain such information as the Attorney-in-Fact, in his or her
discretion, deems necessary or desirable;

c) Neither the Company nor the Attorney-in-Fact assumes any liability for
the undersigned's responsibility to comply with the requirements of Section
16 of the Exchange Act or Rule 144, any liability of the undersigned for
any failure to comply with such requirements, or any liability of the
undersigned for disgorgement of profits under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act; and

d) This Power of Attorney does not relieve the undersigned from
responsibility for compliance with the undersigned's obligations under
Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, the reporting
requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

     The undersigned hereby grants to the Attorney-in-Fact full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite, necessary
or advisable to be done in connection with the foregoing, as fully, to all
intents and purposes, as the undersigned might or could do in person, hereby
ratifying and confirming all that the Attorney-in-Fact, or his or her substitute
or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be done by authority of this
Power of Attorney.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned
is no longer required to file Forms 4 or 5 or Forms 144 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities of the Company, unless
earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
Attorney-in-Fact. This Power of Attorney revokes all previous powers of attorney

with respect to the subject matter of this Power of Attorney.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Power of Attorney
as of December 13, 2022.

                                /s/ Marshall J. Lux
