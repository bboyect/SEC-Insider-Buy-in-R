        <footnote id="F1">Subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments and customary provisions related to partial dividend periods, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), which was originally one-to-one, but was  approximately 1.067 on the date hereof as a result of accrued but unpaid dividends. The Conversion Rate will continue to adjust to the extent there are accrued but unpaid dividends. Each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares (if any). The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that were previously reported as directly held by the Reporting Person are now held indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary.</footnote>
