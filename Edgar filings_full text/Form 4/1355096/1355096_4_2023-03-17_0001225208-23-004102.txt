        <footnote id="F1">On February 16, 2023, the Issuer announced that an authorized committee of its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $2.00 per share of its 8.0% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (&quot;Preferred Stock&quot;) payable on March 15, 2023 to stockholders of record of the Preferred Stock at the close of business on February 28, 2023 (the &quot;Dividend&quot;).  The equivalent rights accrued on restricted stock units with respect to the Issuer's Preferred Stock (&quot;Original RSUs&quot;) held by the reporting person as a result of the Dividend and are subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and expiration) as the Original RSUs to which they relate. Each dividend equivalent right entitles the reporting person to receive one share of the Issuer's Series A Common Stock. The grant of dividend equivalent rights was approved by the Issuer's board of directors pursuant to Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each dividend equivalent right vests upon the reporting person's termination of service to the Issuer's board of directors.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Each dividend equivalent right expires upon the reporting person's termination of service to the Issuer's board of directors.</footnote>
