        <footnote id="F1">These securities represent restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) granted under the Cano Health, Inc. 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. Each unit represents a right to receive one share of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock. The RSUs vest on the earlier of (i) June 15, 2024 or (ii) the Issuer's next annual meeting of stockholders, in each case so long as the reporting person remains in service as a member of the board on such date. These RSUs have been awarded to the reporting person to fully satisfy the Issuer's 2023 total annual equity and cash compensation for non-employee directors. This amount includes RSUs received in lieu of the $50,000 cash portion of the reporting person's total annual compensation based on a price of $1.347 per share (based on the volume weighted average price of the Issuer stock over the twenty business days preceding the grant).</footnote>
