        <footnote id="F1">On April 21, 2023, the Issuer announced that its board of directors had determined to redeem all of its outstanding shares of Class A common stock sold in the Issuer's initial public offering (the &quot;Public Shares&quot;), effective as of May 4, 2023, because the Issuer will not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its amended and restated certificate of incorporation.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">As of the close of business on May 4, 2023, the Public Shares were deemed cancelled and represented only the rights to receive the per-share redemption price. In connection with the redemption of the Public Shares and anticipated dissolution of the Issuer, on May 4, 2023, B. Riley Principal 250 Sponsor Co., LLC (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) forfeited to the Issuer for no consideration 4,312,499 shares of Class B common stock and 600,000 shares of Class A common stock. In connection with the dissolution of the Issuer, on June 2, 2023, the Sponsor surrendered to the Issuer one share of Class B common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">B. Riley Principal Investments, LLC (&quot;BRPI&quot;) is the managing member of B. Riley Principal 250 Sponsor Co., LLC (the &quot;Sponsor&quot;) and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of B. Riley Financial, Inc. (&quot;BRF&quot;). BRPI and BRF had voting and dispositive power over the securities held by the Sponsor. Bryant R. Riley is the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of BRF. Bryant R. Riley is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Issuer. As a result, each of BRPI, BRF and Bryant R. Riley may be deemed to have indirectly beneficially owned the securities directly held the Sponsor. Each of BRPI, BRF and Bryant R. Riley disclaimed beneficial ownership over any securities directly held by the Sponsor other than to the extent of its/his respective pecuniary interest therein, directly or indirectly.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The shares of Class B common stock were convertible for shares of the Issuer's Class A common stock at the time of the Issuer's initial business combination as described under the heading &quot;Description of Securities&quot; in the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333- 253464) (the &quot;Registration Statement&quot;) and had no expiration date.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>The Sponsor, BRPI and BRF may be deemed directors by deputization by virtue of their representation on the board of directors of the Issuer. Bryant R. Riley is Chairman of the board of directors of the Issuer.</remarks>
